# How to run
In order to run the files in conjunction, run the following line in your terminal:
```
gcc main.c utility.c 
```
Make sure all the files are in thesame folder before running otherwise this will compromise the functionality of the program.
It is ESPECIALLY important to have utility.h in the folder in order for the files to work in junction.
